     h2:"Automotive Accessibility: Steering Towards Inclusive Mobility",
     detail:`Last week, the latest technologies in in-cabin sensing, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) were presented during the colocation of InCabin and AutoSens USA in Detroit, Michigan, organised by Sense Media.<br><br>
      In line with emerging standards and regulations, developments in these sectors are largely driven by the demand to improve safety. With driver-related factors such as error, impairment, fatigue, and distraction contributing to approximately 90% of road accidents,¹ systems that monitor, assist, or take over from human drivers are invaluable tools for mitigating risks and saving lives.`,
      h1:"Challenges & Considerations",
      detail2:`It is important to note that ensuring equity and accessibility in  this sector does not solely consist of installing autonomous driving  technologies in wheelchair-compatible vehicles.
      Indeed, Maria Town noted other crucial challenges that need to be  overcome, such as ensuring the technology interacts appropriately with  disabled people. For example, in some cases, sensors have identified the  back of a wheelchair as a trash can, rather than a pedestrian, thus  posing significant potential safety risks. This highlights the need for  systems to be accurate and experienced when identifying and labelling  their surroundings.
      <br><br>
      Furthermore, Town emphasised the importance of ensuring licensing  regulations do not become a barrier to the utility of autonomous driving  for disabled people. Indeed, if states require AV users to hold a  driver’s license, despite not needing to drive the car, the potential  for these vehicles to deliver independence to those who cannot drive  would be greatly diminished.
      Finally, Town also suggested that the value of the technologies  presented at AutoSens and InCabin should be considered beyond automotive  vehicles. For example, by installing sensors on equipment such as  mobility scooters, ease of use for disabled people could be improved in  scenarios such as trying to park in a narrow space on a bus.`

      h2:"Smart Eye Unveils Its Latest Drowsiness Detection Technology",
      detail:`Smart Eye has announced the release of its Smart Eye Pro 12 eye  tracking technology, which includes Profile ID and drowsiness detection  capabilities. <br>
        This technology has initially been developed for automotive projects to improve safety and customer satisfaction.<br>
        Through  its Profile ID feature, Smart Eye Pro 12 assigns a unique number to  each test subject based on facial characteristics. This therefore  eliminates the need for manual identification.
        Smart Eye Pro 12 also has precise drowsiness detection capacities. It  uses sophisticated algorithms to identify the driver’s drowsiness level  on a range from 4 to 9.
        This feature aligns with upcoming legislation which mandates drowsiness detection in new vehicles by 2026. <br>
        Specifically, Smart Eye’s latest release prioritises ongoing  improvements in gaze accuracy and robustness, including advancements in  pupil tracking, to enhance the accuracy of the technology.`,

      detail:`The University of Surrey has launched a new network in collaboration  with the University of the West of England and the University of Bristol  to ensure self-driving vehicles are safely rolled out across the UK. <br>
                The MASSDRIVE project (Methods for Assurance of Self-Driving  Vehicles) is funded by Innovate UK to help the nation and industry  develop methods for approving and certifying self-driving cars. <br> <br>
                This comes as the UK prepares to introduce legislation to pave the way for the introduction of self driving csrs later this year.
                Dr Saber Fallah, Professor of Safe AI and Autonomy at the University of Surrey said: <br> <br>
                MASSDRIVE  is all about bringing together industry, scientists, regulators, and  the public to begin a conversation about how we can make self-driving  cars safe for our roads.
                Our main goal is to make sure these  vehicles are safe. We want to create strong connections between car  makers, people who set the rules, academics, government groups and local  communities. By having regular discussions, workshops and meetings,  we're creating a space where everyone can share ideas and good ways of  doing things, focusing particularly on making sure the AI in cars is  trustworthy.`,
